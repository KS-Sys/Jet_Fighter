A unorginal project presented by me. A video-game which allows the user to select a tank or a jet fighter.

This is a test project so far with nightly commits done on the alpha branch and working commits done on the master branch.
I have put the effort to try to decouple the project from the .logic. I would like to see if i could try to port the game if possible to another engine once it is completed.

I am wanting the program run cross platform once it is stable enough on the DX.
